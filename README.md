# Availing-Various-Transportation-Media-Backend-Java-Development-Project
The project was the main practical evaluative for the ICSE Boards in 2019. It involved using all the Java concepts from our course and implementing them in the booking system.
Executed on BlueJ, the system managed eligibility for discounts, various transport packages offered, flight distance-based ticketing, food services onboard,
billing final prices, booking cancellation and age-related offers based on multiple customer details recorded in strings and arrays.
